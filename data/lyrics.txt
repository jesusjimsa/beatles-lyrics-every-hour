I read the news today, oh boy
About a lucky man who made the grade
And though the news was rather sad
Well, I just had to laugh
I saw the photograph
He blew his mind out in a car
He didn't notice that the lights had changed
A crowd of people stood and stared
They'd seen his face before
Nobody was really sure if he was from the House of Lords
I saw a film today, oh boy
The English army had just won the war
A crowd of people turned away
But I just had to look
Having read the book
I'd love to turn you on
Woke up, fell out of bed
dragged a comb across my head
Found my way downstairs and drank a cup
and looking up, I noticed I was late
Found my coat and grabbed my hat
Made the bus in seconds flat
Found my way upstairs and had a smoke
And somebody spoke and I went into a dream
Ah I read the news today, oh boy
Four thousand holes in Blackburn, Lancashire
And though the holes were rather small
They had to count them all
Now they know how many holes it takes to fill the Albert Hall
I'd love to turn you on
It's been a hard day's night
And I've been working like a dog
It's been a hard day's night
I should be sleeping like a log
But when I get home to you
I find the things that you do
Will make me feel alright
You know I work all day
To get you money to buy you things
And it's worth it just to hear you say
You're gonna give me everything
So why on earth should I moan
'Cause when I get you alone
You know I feel okay
When I'm home
Everything seems to be right
When I'm home
Feeling you holding me tight, tight, yeah
It's been a hard day's night
And I've been working like a dog
It's been a hard day's night
I should be sleeping like a log
But when I get home to you
I find the things that you do
Will make me feel alright
So why on earth should I moan
'Cause when I get you alone
You know I feel okay
When I'm home
Everything seems to be right
When I'm home
Feeling you holding me tight, tight, yeah
It's been a hard day's night
And I've been working like a dog
It's been a hard day's night
I should be sleeping like a log
But when I get home to you
I find the things that you do
Will make me feel alright
Words are flowing out like endless rain into a paper cup
They slither while they pass, they slip away across the universe
Pools of sorrow waves of joy are drifting through my opened mind
Possessing and caressing me
Jai guru deva om
Nothing's gonna change my world
Nothing's gonna change my world
Images of broken light which dance before me like a million eyes
They call me on and on across the universe
Thoughts meander like a restless wind
Inside a letter box they
Tumble blindly as they make their way
Across the universe
Jai guru deva om
Nothing's gonna change my world
Nothing's gonna change my world
Sounds of laughter shades of life are ringing
Through my open ears inciting and inviting me
Limitless undying love which shines around me like a million suns
And calls me on and on across the universe
Jai guru deva om
Nothing's gonna change my world
Nothing's gonna change my world
Whenever I want you around, yeah
All I gotta do is call you on the phone
And you'll come running home
yeah that's all I gotta do
And when I wanna kiss you, yeah
All I gotta do is whisper in your ear
The words you long to hear
And I'll be kissin' you
And the same goes for me, whenever you want me at all

You just gotta call on me, yeah

Mmmmmm mm mm
Close your eyes and I'll kiss you
Tomorrow I'll miss you
Remember I'll always be true
And then while I'm away
I'll write home everyday
And I'll send all my loving to you
I'll pretend that I'm kissing
The lips I am missing
And hope that my dreams will come true
And then while I'm away
I'll write home everyday
And I'll send all my loving to you

Sunrise doesn't last all morning
A cloudburst doesn't last all day
Seems my love is up and has left you with no warning
It's not always going to be this grey
All things must pass
All things must pass away
Sunset doesn't last all evening
A mind can blow those clouds away
After all this, my love is up and must be leaving
It's not always going to be this grey
All things must pass
All things must pass away
All things must pass
None of life's strings can last
So, I must be on my way
And face another day
Now the darkness only stays the night-time
In the morning it will fade away
Daylight is good at arriving at the right time
It's not always going to be this grey
All things must pass
All things must pass away
All things must pass
All things must pass away
One, two, three, four
Can I have a little more
Five, six, seven, eight, nine, ten
I love you
A, B, C, D
Can I bring my friend to tea
E, F, G, H, I, J
I love you

There's nothing you can do that can't be done
Nothing you can sing that can't be sung
Nothing you can say but you can learn how to play the game
It's easy
Nothing you can make that can't be made
No one you can save that can't be saved
Nothing you can do, but you can learn how to be you in time
It's easy
All you need is love
All you need is love
All you need is love, love
Love is all you need
All you need is love
All you need is love
All you need is love, love
Love is all you need

You'd love her too

She gives me everything
And tenderly
The kiss my lover brings
She brings to me
And I love her
A love like ours
Could never die
As long as I
Have you near me
Bright are the stars that shine
Dark is the sky
I know this love of mine
Will never die
And I love her
Tell me that you've got ev'rything you want
And your bird can sing
But you don't get me
You don't get me
You say you've seen seven wonders
And your bird is green
But you can't see me
You can't see me
When your prized possessions
Start to weigh you down
Look in my direction
I'll be 'round, I'll be 'round
When your bird is broken
Will it bring you down?
You may be awoken
I'll be 'round, I'll be 'round
You tell me that you've heard ev'ry sound there is
And your bird can swing
But you can't hear me
You can't hear me
For I have got
Another girl
Another girl
You're makin' me say that I've got nobody but you
But as from today, well, I've got somebody that's new
I ain't no fool, and I don't take what I don't want
For I have got
Another girl
Another girl
She's sweeter than all the girls, and I've met quite a few
Nobody in all the world can do what she can do
And so I'm telling you, this time you'd better stop
For I have got
Another girl
Another girl
Who will love me till the end
Through thick and thin she will always be my friend
I don't wanna say that I've been unhappy with you
But as from today, well, I've seen somebody that's new
I ain't no fool, and I don't take what I don't want
For I have got
Another girl

Through thick and thin she will always be my friend
I don't wanna say that I've been unhappy with you

For I have got
Another girl

Now you're mine
My happiness still makes me cry
And in time you'll understand the reasons why
If I cry it's not because I'm sad
But you're the only love that I've ever had

Well, well, well, you're feeling fine
Well, well, well, he'll make you Doctor Robert
Ring my friend I said you'd call
Doctor Robert
Since she's been gone I want no one to talk to me
It's not the same but I'm to blame, it's plain to see
So go away, leave me alone, don't bother me
I can't believe that she would leave me on my own
It's just not right when every night I'm all alone
I've got no time for you right now, don't bother me
I know I'll never be the same if I don't get her back again
Because I know she'll always be the only girl for me
But 'till she's here please don't come near, just stay away
I'll let you know when she's come home. Until that day
Don't come around, leave me alone, don't bother me
I've got no time for you right now, don't bother me
I know I'll never be the same if I don't get her back again
Because I know she'll always be the only girl for me
But 'till she's here please don't come near, just stay away
I'll let you know when she's come home. Until that day
Don't come around, leave me alone, don't bother me
Don't bother me
Don't bother me
Don't bother me
Don't bother me
Don't let me down
Don't let me down
Don't let me down
Don't let me down
Nobody ever loved me like she does
Oo she does. Yes, she does
And if somebody loved me like she do me
Oo she do me. Yes, she does
Don't let me down
Don't let me down
Don't let me down
Don't let me down
I'm in love for the first time
Don't you know it's gonna last
It's a love that lasts forever
It's a love that had no past
Don't let me down
Don't let me down
Don't let me down
Don't let me down
And from the first time that she really done
Me oo she done me, she done me good
I guess nobody ever really done me
Oo she done me, she done me good
Don't let me down
Don't let me down
Don't let me down
Don't let me down
I listen for your footsteps coming up the drive
Listen for your footsteps but they don't arrive
Waiting for your knock dear on my old front door
I don't hear it
Does it mean you don't love me anymore?
I hear the clock a-ticking on the mantel shelf
See the hands a-moving but I'm by myself
I wonder where you are tonight and why I'm by myself
I don't see you
Does it mean you don't love me anymore?
Don't pass me by, don't make me cry, don't make me blue
Cause you know daring I love only you
You'll never know it hurt me so
How I hate to see you go
Don't pass me by, don't make me cry
I'm sorry that I doubted you, I was so unfair
You were in a car crash and you lost your hair
You said that you would be late, about an hour or two
I said that's all right
I'm waiting here, just waiting to hear from you
Don't pass me by, don't make me cry, don't make me blue
Cause you know daring I love only you
You'll never know it hurt me so
How I hate to see you go
Don't pass me by, don't make me cry

Ah, look at all the lonely people!
Ah, look at all the lonely people!
Eleanor Rigby picks up the rice in the church where a wedding has been
Lives in a dream
Waits at the window, wearing the face that she keeps in a jar by the door
Who is it for?
All the lonely people
Where do they all come from?
All the lonely people
Where do they all belong?
Father McKenzie writing the words of a sermon that no one will hear
No one comes near
Look at him working, darning his socks in the night when there's nobody there
What does he care?
All the lonely people
Where do they all come from?
All the lonely people
Where do they all belong?
Ah, look at all the lonely people!
Ah, look at all the lonely people!
Eleanor Rigby, died in the church and was buried along with her name
Nobody came
Father McKenzie, wiping the dirt from his hands as he walks from the grave
No one was saved
All the lonely people

All the lonely people
Where do they all belong?
When I'm walking beside her
People tell me I'm lucky
Yes, I know I'm a lucky guy

Well they took some honey from a tree
Dressed it up and they called it me
Everybody's trying to be my baby
Everybody's trying to be my baby
Everybody's trying to be my baby now
Woke up last night, half past four
Fifty women knocking on my door
Everybody's trying to be my baby
Everybody's trying to be my baby
Everybody's trying to be my baby now
(Instrumental/solo)
Went out last night I didn't stay late
'fore I got home I had nineteen dates
Everybody's trying to be my baby

I'm fixing a hole where the rain gets in
And stops my mind from wandering
Where it will go
I'm filling the cracks that ran through the door
And kept my mind from wandering
Where it will go
And it really doesn't matter
If I'm wrong, I'm right
Where I belong, I'm right
Where I belong
See the people standing there
Who disagree and never win
And wonder why they don't get in my door
I'm painting the room in a colorful way
And when my mind is wandering
There I will go
Ooh ooh ooh ah. Hey hey hey
And it really doesn't matter
If I'm wrong, I'm right
Where I belong, I'm right
Where I belong
Silly people run around
Who worry me and never ask me
Why they don't get past my door
I'm taking the time for a number of things
That weren't important yesterday
And I still go
Ooh ooh ooh ooh ah
I'm fixing a hole where the rain gets in
And stops my mind from wandering
Where it will go
Where it will go
Your day breaks
Your mind aches
You find that all her words of kindness linger on
When she no longer needs you
She wakes up
She makes up
She takes her time and doesn't feel she has to hurry
She no longer needs you
And in her eyes you see nothing
No sign of love behind the tears cried for no one
A love that should have lasted years
You want her
You need her
And yet you don't believe her when she says her love is dead
You think she needs you
And in her eyes you see nothing
No sign of love behind the tears cried for no one
A love that should have lasted years
You stay home
She goes out
She says that long ago she knew someone but now he's gone
She doesn't need him
Your day breaks
Your mind aches
There will be times when all the things she said will fill your head
You won't forget her
And in her eyes you see nothing
No sign of love behind the tears cried for no one
A love that should have lasted years
Because you're sweet and lovely girl, I love you
Because you're sweet and lovely girl, it's true
I love you more than ever girl, I do
I want you in the morning girl, I love you
I want you at the moment I feel blue
I'm living every moment girl for you
Bop
Bop cat bop
Go Johnny go
Same ol' twelve bar blues
(Elmo James got nothin' on this, baby)
I loved you from the moment I saw you
You looked at me, that's all you had to do
I feel it now, I hope you feel it too
Because you're sweet and lovely girl, I love you
Because you're sweet and lovely girl, it's true
I love you more than ever girl, I do
I'm livin' the blues
Free as a bird
It's the next best thing to be
Free as a bird
Home, home and dry
Like a homing bird I'll fly
As a bird on wings
Whatever happened to
The life that we once knew?
Can we really live without each other?
Where did we lose the touch
That seemed to mean so much?
It always made me feel so
Free as a bird
Like the next best thing to be
Free as a bird
Home, home and dry
Like a homing bird I'll fly
As a bird on wings
Whatever happened to
The life that we once knew?
Always made me feel so free
Free as a bird
It's the next best thing to be
Free as a bird
Free as a bird
Free as a bird
Free

All about the girl who came to stay?
She's the kind of girl you want so much it makes you sorry
Still, you don't regret a single day
Ah girl, girl, girl
When I think of all the times I tried so hard to leave her
She will turn to me and start to cry
And she promises the earth to me and I believe her
After all this time I don't know why
Ah girl, girl, girl

When friends are there, You feel a fool
When you say she's looking good
She acts as if it's understood. She's cool, ooh, ooh, ooh
Ah girl, girl, girl
Was told when she was young that pain would lead to pleasure?
Did she understand it when they said
That a man must break his back to earn his day of leisure?
Will she still believe it when he's dead?
Ah girl, girl, girl

To see how the other half live
Looking through a glass onion

Fixing a hole in the ocean
Trying to make a dove-tail joint, yeah
Looking through a glass onion

Nothing to do to save his life call his wife in
Nothing to say but what a day how's your boy been
Nothing to do it's up to you
I've got nothing to say but it's O.K
Good morning, good morning, good morning.
Going to work don't want to go feeling low down
Heading for home you start to roam then you're in town
Everybody knows there's nothing doing
Everything is closed it's like a ruin
Everyone you see is half asleep
And you're on your own you're in the street
After a while you start to smile now you feel cool
Then you decide to take a walk by the old school
Nothing had changed it's still the same
I've got nothing to say but it's O.K
Good morning, good morning, good morning.
People running round it's five o'clock
Everywhere in town it's getting dark
Everyone you see is full of life
It's time for tea and meet the wife
Somebody needs to know the time, glad that I'm here
Watching the skirts you start to flirt now you're in gear
Go to a show you hope she goes
I've got nothing to say but it's O.K
Good morning, good morning, good morning
Good Night

Good night
I was alone, I took a ride
I didn't know what I would find there
Another road where maybe I
Could see another kind of mind there
Ooh, then I suddenly see you
Ooh, did I tell you I need you
Ev'ry single day of my life?
You didn't run, you didn't lie
You knew I wanted just to hold you
And had you gone, you knew in time we'd meet again
For I had told you
Ooh, you were meant to be near me
Ooh, and I want you to hear me
Say we'll be together ev'ry day
Got to get you into my life!
What can I do, what can I be?
When I'm with you, I want to stay there
If I'm true I'll never leave
And if I do, I know the way there
Ooh, then I suddenly see you
Ooh, did I tell you I need you
Ev'ry single day of my life?
Got to get you into my life!
She's not a girl who misses much
Do do do do do do do do
She's well acquainted with the touch of the velvet hand
Like a lizard on a window pane
The man in the crowd with the multicolored mirrors
On his hobnail boots
Lying with his eyes while his hands are busy
Working overtime
A soap impression of his wife which he ate
And donated to the National Trust
I need a fix 'cause I'm going down
Down to the bits that I left uptown
I need a fix 'cause I'm going down
Mother Superior jump the gun

When I was younger, so much younger than today

And I do appreciate you being 'round
Help me get my feet back on the ground

Help me if you can, I'm feeling down
And I do appreciate you being 'round
Help me get my feet back on the ground
Won't you please, please help me?
When I was younger, so much younger than today

Here comes the sun
Doo doo doo doo
Here comes the sun and I say
It's alright
Little darling, it's been a long, cold, lonely winter
Little darling, it feels like years since it's been here
Here comes the sun
Doo doo doo doo
Here comes the sun and I say
It's alright
Little darling, the smiles returning to the faces
Little darling, it seems like years since it's been here
Here comes the sun
Doo doo doo doo
Here comes the sun and I say
It's alright
Sun, sun, sun
Here it comes x 5
Little darling, I feel that ice is slowly melting
Little darling, it seems like years since it's been clear
Here comes the sun
Doo doo doo doo
Here comes the sun and I say
It's alright
Here comes the sun
Doo doo doo doo
Here comes the sun
It's alright
It's alright
To lead a better life
I need my love to be here
Here, making each day of the year
Changing my life with a wave of her hand
Nobody can deny that there's something there
There, running my hands through her hair
Both of us thinking how good it can be
Someone is speaking, but she doesn't know he's there
I want her everywhere
And if she's beside me I know I need never care
But to love her is to need her everywhere
Knowing that love is to share
Each one believing that love never dies
Watching her and hoping I'm always there
I want her everywhere
And if she's beside me I know I need never care
But to love her is to need her everywhere
Knowing that love is to share
Each one believing that love never dies
Watching her and hoping I'm always there
I will be there
And everywhere
Here, there and everywhere
Sheep dog standing in the rain
bullfrog doing it again
Some kind of happiness is measured out in miles
What makes you think you're something special when you smile?
Childlike no one understands
Jackknife in your sweaty hands
Some kind of innocence is measured out in years
You don't know what it's like to listen to your fears
You can talk to me
You can talk to me
You can talk to me
If you're lonely you can talk to me
Big man walking in the park
Wigwam frightened of the dark
Some kind of solitude is measured out in you
You think you know it but you haven't got a clue
You can talk to me
You can talk to me
You can talk to me
If you're lonely you can talk to me. (Wowwa!)
Hey bulldog. Hey bulldog. Hey bulldog. Hey bulldog
Hey Jude, don't make it bad
Take a sad song and make it better
Remember to let her into your heart
Then you can start to make it better
Jude, don't be afraid
You were made to go out and get her
The minute you let her under your skin
Then you begin to make it better
And anytime you feel the pain
Hey Jude, refrain
Don't carry the world upon your shoulder
For well, you know that it's a fool
Who plays it cool
By making his world a little colder
Na, na, na, na, na na, na, na. na
Hey Jude, don't let me down
You have found her, now go and get her
Remember to let her into your heart
Then you can start to make it better
So let it out and let it in
Hey Jude, begin, you're waiting for someone to perform with
And don't you know that it's just you?
Hey Jude, you'll do, the movement you need is on your shoulder
Na, na, na, na, na na, na, na. na
Hey Jude, don't make it bad
Take a sad song and make it better
Remember to let her under your skin
Then you begin to make it better, better, better, better, better, better, oh!
Na, na, na, na, na, na, na, na, na, na, na, na, hey, Jude

Kindly send her sailing back to me. Tttee

I don't want to spoil the party so I'll go
I would hate my disappointment to show
There's nothing for me here
So I will disappear
if she turns up while I'm gone, please let me know
I've had a drink or two and I don't care
There's no fun in what I do if she's not there
I wonder what went wrong
I've waited far too long
I think I'll take a walk and look for her
Though tonight she's made me sad
I still love her
If I find her I'll be glad
I still love her
I don't want to spoil the party so I'll go

How was I to know you would upset me
I didn't realise as I looked in your eyes
You told me, oh yes you told me
You don't want my lovin' anymore
That's when it hurt me and feeling like this
I just don't go on anymore
Please remember how I feel about you
I could never really live without you
So, come on back and see
Just what you mean to me

Oh when I saw her standing there
Well she looked at me
And I, I could see
That before too long I'd fall in love with her
She wouldn't dance with another
Oh when I saw her standing there
Well my heart went boom when I crossed that room
And I held her hand in mine
Oh we danced through the night
And we held each other tight
And before too long I fell in love with her
Now I'll never dance with another
Oh when I saw her standing there
Well my heart went boom when I crossed that room
And I held her hand in mine
Oh we danced through the night
And we held each other tight
And before too long I fell in love with her
Now I'll never dance with another

My head is filled with things to say
When you're here
All those words they seem to slip away
When I get near you
The games begin to drag me down
It's alright
I'll make you maybe next time around
But if I seem to act unkind
It's only me, it's not my mind
That is confusing things
I want to tell you
I feel hung up and I don't know why
I don't mind, I could wait for ever
I've got time
Sometimes I wish I knew you well
Then I could speak my mind and tell you
Maybe you'd understand
I want to tell you
I feel hung up and I don't know why
I don't mind, I could wait for ever
I've got time. I've got time
I want you
I want you so bad

It's driving me mad, it's driving me mad
She's so heavy, heavy
Who knows how long I've loved you
You know I love you still
Will I wait a lonely lifetime
If you want me to I will
For if I ever saw you
I didn't catch your name
But it never really mattered
I will always feel the same
Love you forever and forever
Love you with all my heart
Love you when we're together
Love you when we're apart
And when at last I find you
Your song will fill the air
Sing it loud so I can hear you
For the things you do
Endear you to me
You know I will
I will
You know if you break my heart I'll go
But I'll be back again
'Cause I told you once before goodbye
But I came back again
I love you so oh, I'm the one who wants you
Yes, I'm the one who wants you, oh ho, oh ho
Oh, you could find better things to do
Than to break my heart again
This time I will try to show that I'm
Not trying to pretend
I thought that you would realize
That if I ran away from you
That you would want me to
But I got a big surprise, oh ho, oh ho
Oh, you could find better things to do
Than to break my heart again
This time I will try to show that I'm
Not trying to pretend
I wanna go, but I hate to leave you
You know I hate to leave you, oh ho, oh ho, oh
I've got ev'ry reason on earth to be mad
'cause I've just lost the only girl I had
And if I could get my way
I'd get myself locked up today
But I can't, so I'll cry instead
I've got a chip on my shoulder that's bigger than my feet
I can't talk to people that I meet
If I could see you now
I'd try to make you sad somehow
But I can't, so I'll cry instead
Don't want to cry when there's people there
I get shy when they start to stare
I'm gonna hide myself away hey
But I'll come back again some day
And when I do, you better hide all the girls
I'm gonna break their hearts all 'round the world
Yes, I'm gonna break 'em in two
And show you what your lovin' man can do
Until then I'll cry instead
Don't want to cry when there's people there
I get shy when they start to stare
I'm gonna hide myself away hey
But I'll come back again some day
And when I do, you better hide all the girls
'Cause I'm gonna break their hearts all 'round the world
Yes, I'm gonna break 'em in two
And show you what your lovin' man can do
Until then I'll cry instead
One day you'll look to see I've gone
For tomorrow may rain, so I'll follow the sun
Some day you'll know I was the one
But, tomorrow may rain, so I'll follow the sun
And now the time has come
And so, my love, I must go
And though I lose a friend
In the end you will know. Oh
One day you'll find that I have gone
But, tomorrow may rain, so I'll follow the sun
Yeah, tomorrow may rain, so I'll follow the sun
And now the time has come
And so, my love, I must go
And though I lose a friend
In the end you will know. Oh
One day you'll find that I have gone
But, tomorrow may rain, so I'll follow the sun
Oh yeah, Oh yeah
Oh yeah Oh yeah
Imagine I'm in love with you
It's easy 'cause I know
I've imagined I'm in love with you
Many, many, many times before
It's not like me to pretend
But I'll get you, I'll get you in the end
Yes, I will, I'll get you in the end
Oh yeah, Oh yeah
I think about you night and day
I need you and it's true
When I think about you, I can say
I'm never, never, never, never blue
So I'm telling you, my friend
That I'll get you, I'll get you in the end
Yes, I will, I'll get you in the end
Oh yeah, Oh yeah
Well, there's gonna be a time
When I'm gonna change your mind
So you might as well resign yourself to me. Oh yeah
Imagine I'm in love with you
It's easy 'cause I know
I've imagined I'm in love with you
Many, many, many times before
It's not like me to pretend
But I'll get you, I'll get you in the end
Yes, I will, I'll get you in the end
Oh yeah, Oh yeah
Oh yeah, Oh yeah
Whoa yeah
I'm a loser, I'm a loser
And I'm not what I appear to be
Of all the love I have won or have lost
There is one love I should never have crossed
She was a girl in a million my friend
I should have known she would win in the end
I'm a loser, and I lost someone who's near to me
I'm a loser, and I'm not what I appear to be
Although I laugh and I act like a clown
Beneath this mask I am wearing a frown
My tears are falling like rain from the sky
Is it for her or myself that I cry?
I'm a loser, and I lost someone who's near to me
I'm a loser, and I'm not what I appear to be
What have I done to deserve such a fate?
I realize I have left it too late
And so it's true, pride comes before a fall
I'm telling you so that you won't lose all
I'm a loser, and I lost someone who's near to me
I'm a loser, and I'm not what I appear to be
You tell lies thinkin' I can't see
You can't cry 'cause you're laughin' at me
I'm down. (I'm really down.)
I'm down. (Down on the ground.)
I'm down. (I'm really down.)
How can you laugh when you know I'm down?
How can you laugh know I'm down?
Man buys ring, woman throws it away
Same old thing happen every day
I'm down. (I'm really down.)
I'm down. (Down on the ground.)
I'm down. (I'm really down.)
How can you laugh when you know I'm down?
How can you laugh know I'm down?
We're all alone and there's nobody else
She'll still moan, "Keep your hands to yourself!"
I'm down. (I'm really down.)
I'm down. (Down on the ground.)
I'm down. (I'm really down.)
How can you laugh when you know I'm down?
How can you laugh know I'm down?
A baby you know I'm down. (I'm really down.)
I guess I'm down. (I'm really down.)
I'm down on the ground. (I'm really down.)
I'm down. (I'm really down.)
Ah, baby, I'm upsidedown
Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
I'm really down
Before this dance is through
I think I'll love you too
I'm so happy when you dance with me
I don't want to kiss or hold your hand
If it's funny, try and understand
There is really nothing else I'd rather do
'Cause I'm happy just to dance with you
I don't need to hug or hold you tight
I just wanna dance with you all night
In this world there's nothing I would rather do
Cause I'm happy just to dance with you
Just to dance with you is ev'rything I need
Before this dance is through I think I'll love you too
I'm so happy when you dance with me
If somebody tries to take my place
let's pretend we just can't see his face
In this world there's nothing I would rather do
'Cause I'm happy just to dance with you
Just to dance with you is ev'rything I need
Before this dance is through I think I'll love you too
I'm so happy when you dance with me
If somebody tries to take my place
let's pretend we just can't see his face
In this world there's nothing I would rather do
I've discovered I'm in love with you
'Cause I'm happy just to dance with you
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh!
I'm looking through you
Where did you go?
I thought I knew you
What did I know?
You don't look diff'rent
But you have changed
I'm looking through you
You're not the same
Your lips are moving
I cannot hear
Your voice is soothing
But the words aren't clear
You don't sound diff'rent
I've learned the game
I'm looking through you
You're not the same
Why, tell me why did you not treat me right?
Love has a nasty habit of disappearing overnight
You're thinking of me
The same old way
You were above me
But not today
The only diff'rence is you're down there
I'm looking through you and you're nowhere
Why, tell me why did you not treat me right?
Love has a nasty habit of disappearing overnight
I'm looking through you
Where did you go?
I thought I knew you
What did I know?
You don't look diff'rent, but you have changed
I'm looking through you, you're not the same
Yeah! Well, baby, you've changed. Ah, I'm looking through you.
When I wake up early in the morning
Lift my head, I'm still yawning
When I'm in the middle of a dream
Stay in bed, float up stream (float up stream)
Please don't wake me, no, don't shake me
Leave me where I am, I'm only sleeping
Everybody seems to think I'm lazy
I don't mind, I think they're crazy
Running everywhere at such a speed
Till they find there's no need (there's no need)
Please don't spoil my day, I'm miles away
And after all, I'm only sleeping
Keeping an eye on the world going by my window
Taking my time, lying there and staring at the ceiling
Waiting for a sleepy feeling
Please don't spoil my day, I'm miles away
And after all, I'm only sleeping
Keeping an eye on the world going by my window
Taking my time
When I wake up early in the morning
Lift my head, I'm still yawning
When I'm in the middle of a dream
Stay in bed, float up stream (float up stream)
Please don't wake me, no, don't shake me
Leave me where I am, I'm only sleeping
I'm so tired, I haven't slept a wink
I'm so tired, my mind is on the blink
I wonder should I get up and fix myself a drink
No, no, no
I'm so tired I don't know what to do
I'm so tired my mind is set on you
I wonder should I call you but I know what you'd do
You'd say I'm putting you on
But it's no joke, it's doing me harm
You know I can't sleep, I can't stop my brain
You know it's three weeks, I'm going insane
You know I'd give you everything I've got
For a little peace of mind
I'm so tired, I'm feeling so upset
Although I'm so tired, I'll have another cigarette
And curse Sir Walter Raleigh
He was such a stupid get
You'd say I'm putting you on
But it's no joke, it's doing me harm
You know I can't sleep, I can't stop my brain
You know it's three weeks, I'm going insane
You know I'd give you everything I've got
For a little peace of mind
I've got a feeling
A feeling deep inside
Oh yeah, oh yeah, that's right
I've got a feeling, a feeling I can't hide
Oh no, no, oh no, oh no
Yeah, yeah, I've got a feeling, yeah, whoo
Oh please believe me
I'd hate to miss the train
Oh yeah, yeah, oh yeah
And if you leave me
I won't be late again, oh no, oh no, oh no
Yeah, yeah, I've got a feeling, yeah I've got a feeling
All these years I've been wandering around
Wondering how come nobody told me
All that I've been looking for was somebody who looked like you
Oo. I've got a feeling, that keeps me on my toes
Oh yeah, oh yeah
I've got a feeling, I think that ev'rybody knows
Oh yeah, oh yeah, oh yeah
Yeah, yeah, I've got a feeling, yeah, yeah

I can't forget the time or place where we just met
She's just the girl for me
And I want all the world to see we've met
Mm mm mm mm mm
Had it been another day
I might have looked the other way
And I'd have never been aware
But as it is I'll dream of her tonight
Da da da da da da
Falling, yes I am falling
And she keeps calling me back again
I have never known the like of this
I've been alone and
I have missed things and kept out of sight
For other girls were never quite like this
Da da da da da da
Falling, yes I am falling
And she keeps calling me back again
I've just seen a face
I can't forget the time or place where we just met
She's just the girl for me
And I want all the world to see we've met
Mm mm mm mm mm
Falling, yes I am falling
And she keeps calling me back again
If I fell in love with you
Would you promise to be true
And help me understand?
'Cause I've been in love before
And I found that love was more
Than just holding hands
If I give my heart to you
I must be sure
From the very start that you
Would love me more than her
If I trust in you, oh please
Don't run and hide
If I love you too, oh please
Don't hurt my pride like her
'Cause I couldn't stand the pain
And I would be sad if our new love
Was in vain
So I hope you see that I
Would love to love you
And that she will cry
When she learns we are two
'Cause I couldn't stand the pain
And I would be sad if our new love
Was in vain
So I hope you see that I
Would love to love you
And that she will cry
When she learns we are two
If I fell in love with you
If I needed someone to love you're the one that I'd be thinking of
If I needed someone
If I had some more time to spend
Then I guess I'd be with you my friend if I needed someone
Had you come some other day then it might not have been like this
But you see now I'm too much in love
Carve your number on my wall and maybe you will get a call from me
If I needed someone
If I had some more time to spend
Then I guess I'd be with you my friend if I needed someone
Had you come some other day then it might not have been like this
But you see now I'm too much in love
Carve your number on my wall and maybe you will get a call from me
If I needed someone
If you've got trouble
Then you got less trouble than me
You say you're worried
You can't be as worried as me
You're quite content to be bad
With all the advantage you had over me
Just cause your trouble
And don't bring your troubles to me
I don't think it's funny
When you ask for money and things
Especially when you're standing there
Wearing diamonds and rings
You think I'm soft in the head
Well try someone softer instead anything
It's not so funny
When you know what money can bring
You better leave me alone
I don't need a thing from you
You better take yourself home
Go and count a ring or two
If you've got trouble
Then you got less trouble than me
You say you're worried
You can't be as worried as me
You're quite content to be bad
With all the advantage you had over me
Just cause your trouble
And don't bring your troubles to me
Ah rock on, anybody
You better leave me alone
I don't need a thing from you
You better take yourself home
Go and count a ring or two
If you've got trouble
Then you got less trouble than me
You say you're worried
You can't be as worried as me
You're quite content to be bad
With all the advantage you had over me
Just cause your trouble
And don't bring your troubles to me
Just cause your trouble
And don't bring your troubles to me
There are places I'll remember
All my life, though some have changed
Some forever, not for better
Some have gone and some remain
All these places had their moments
With lovers and friends I still can recall
Some are dead and some are living
In my life I've loved them all
But of all these friends and lovers
There is no one compares with you
And these mem'ries lose their meaning
When I think of love as something new
Tho' I know I'll never lose affection
For people and things that went before
I know I'll often stop and think about them
In my life I love you more
Tho' I know I'll never lose affection
For people and things that went before
I know I'll often stop and think about them
In my life I love you more
In my life I love you more
In spite of all the danger
In spite of all that may be
I'll do anything for you
Anything you want me to
If you'll be true to me
In spite of all the heartache
That you may cause me
I'll do anything for you
Anything you want me to
If you'll be true to me
I'll look after you
Like I've never done before
I'll keep all the others
From knocking at your door
In spite of all the danger
In spite of all that may be
I'll do anything for you
Anything you want me to
If you'll be true to me
In spite of all the heartache
That you may cause me
I'll do anything for you
Anything you want me to
If you'll be true to me
I'll do anything for you
Anything you want me to
If you'll be true to me
It won't be long, yeah, (Yeah) yeah, (Yeah) yeah, (Yeah)
It won't be long, yeah, (Yeah) yeah, (Yeah) yeah, (Yeah)
It won't be long, yeah, (Yeah) till I belong to you
Ev'ry night when ev'rybody has fun
Here am I sitting all on my own
It won't be long, yeah, (Yeah) yeah, (Yeah) yeah, (Yeah)
It won't be long, yeah, (Yeah) yeah, (Yeah) yeah, (Yeah)
It won't be long, yeah, (Yeah) till I belong to you
Since you left me I'm so alone
Now you're coming, you're coming on home
I'll be good like I know I should
you're coming home, you're coming home
Ev'ry night the tears come down from my eyes
Ev'ry day I've done nothing but cry
It won't be long, yeah, (Yeah) yeah, (Yeah) yeah, (Yeah)
It won't be long, yeah, (Yeah) yeah, (Yeah) yeah, (Yeah)
It won't be long, yeah, (Yeah) till I belong to you
Since you left me I'm so alone
Now you're coming, you're coming on home
I'll be good like I know I should
You're coming home, you're coming home
So ev'ry day we'll be happy I know
Now I know that you won't leave me no more
It won't be long, yeah, (Yeah) yeah, (Yeah) yeah, (Yeah)
It won't be long, yeah, (Yeah) yeah, (Yeah) yeah, (Yeah)
It won't be long, yeah, (Yeah) till I belong to you
It's all too much
It's all too much
When I look into your eyes
Your love is there for me
And the more I go inside
The more there is to see
It's all too much for me to take
The love that's shining all around you
Everywhere it's what you make for us to take, it's all too much
Floating down the stream of time
From life to life with me
Makes no difference where you are or where you'd like to be
It's all too much for me to take
The love that's shining all around here
All the world is birthday cake so take a piece but not too much
Sail me on a silver sun
Where I know that I'm free
Show me that I'm everywhere and get me home for tea
It's all too much for me to see
A love that's shining all around here
The more I learn, the less I know
And what I do is all too much
It's all too much for me to take
A love that's shining all around you
Everywhere it's what you make for us to take it's all too much
It's too much, it's too much
...with your long blond hair and your eyes of blue
Too much, too much, too much
I get high when I see you go by
My oh my
When you sigh my, my inside just flies
Butterflies
Why am I so shy when I'm beside you?
It's only love and that is all
Why should I feel the way I do?
It's only love and that is all
But it's so hard loving you
Is it right that you and I should fight
Ev'ry night?
Just the sight of you makes nighttime bright
Very bright
Haven't I the right to make it up, girl?
It's only love and that is all
Why should I feel the way I do?
It's only love and that is all
But it's so hard loving you
Yes, it's so hard loving you, loving you
Half of what I say is meaningless
But I say it just to reach you, Julia, Julia
Julia, ocean child, calls me
So I sing a song of love, Julia
Julia seashell eyes
Windy smile, calls me
So I sing a song of love, Julia
Her hair of floating sky is shimmering
Glimmering
In the sun
Julia, Julia, morning moon, touch me
So I sing a song of love, Julia
When I cannot sing my heart
I can only speak my mind, Julia
Julia sleeping sand, silent cloud, touch me
So I sing a song of love, Julia
Mmm calls me
So I sing a song of love for Julia, Julia, Julia
Motor cars, handle bars
Bicycles for two
Broken hearted jubilee
Parachutes, army boots
Sleeping bags for two
Sentimental jamboree
Buy! buy!
Says the sign in the shop window
Why? why?
Says the junk in the yard
Da da ya da da da
Da da da
Da da ya da da
Da da da da da da da
Candlesticks, building bricks
Something old and new
Memories for you and me
Buy! buy!
Says the sign in the shop window
Why? why?
Says the junk in the yard

Lady Madonna, children at your feet
Wonder how you manage to make ends meet
Who finds the money when you pay the rent?
Did you think that money was heaven sent?
Friday night arrives without a suitcase
Sunday morning creeping like a nun
Monday's child has learned to tie his bootlace
See how they run
Lady Madonna, baby at your breast
Wonder how you manage to feed the rest
See how they run
Lady Madonna, lying on the bed
Listen to the music playing in your head
Tuesday afternoon is never ending
Wednesday morning papers didn't come
Thursday night your stockings needed mending
See how they run
Lady Madonna, children at your feet
Wonder how you manage to make ends meet
When I find myself in times of trouble
Mother Mary comes to me
Speaking words of wisdom
Let it be
And in my hour of darkness
She is standing right in front of me
Speaking words of wisdom
Let it be
Let it be, let it be, let it be, let it be
Whisper words of wisdom
Let it be
And when the broken-hearted people
Living in the world agree
There will be an answer
Let it be
For though they may be parted there is
Still a chance that they will see
There will be an answer
Let it be
Let it be, let it be, let it be, let it be
There will be an answer
Let it be
And when the night is cloudy
There is still a light that shines on me
Shine until tomorrow
Let it be
I wake up to the sound of music
Mother Mary comes to me
Speaking words of wisdom
Let it be
Let it be, let it be, let it be, let it be
There will be an answer
Let it be
Let it be, let it be, let it be, let it be
Whisper words of wisdom
Let it be.
I, I saw a girl in my dreams
And so it seems
That I will love her
Oh you, you are that girl
In my dreams
And so it seems
That I will love you
And I waited for your kiss
Waited for the bliss
Like dreamers do
And I, I, I
Oh I'll be there, yeah
Waiting for you, you, you
You, you came just one dream ago
And now I know that I will love you
Oh I knew when you first said hello
That's how I know
That I will love you
And I, I, I waited for your kiss
Waited for the bliss
Like dreamers do
And I, I, I
Oh I'll be there, yeah
Waiting for you, you, you
You, you came just one dream ago
And now I know that I will love you
Oh I knew when you first said hello
That's how I know
That I will love you
And I, I, I waited for your kiss
Waited for the bliss
Like dreamers do
Oh like dreamers do
Like dreamers do

It's been a long long long time
How could I ever have lost you
When I loved you
It took a long long long time
Now I'm so happy I found you
How I love you
So many tears I was searching
So many tears I was wasting, oh, oh
Now I can see you, be you
How can I ever misplace you
How I want you
Oh I love you
You know that I need you
Oh I love you
Love, love me do
You know I love you
I'll always be true
So please
Love me do

Each day just goes so fast
I turn around, it's past
You don't get time to hang a sign on me
Love me while you can
Before I'm a dead old man
A life-time is so short
A new one can't be bought
But what you've got means such a lot to me
Make love all day long
Make love singing songs
Make love all day long
Make love singing songs
There's people standing round
Who'll screw you in the ground
They'll fill you in with their sins
You'll see
I'll make love to you
If you want me to
Ah. Lovely Rita, meter maid
Lovely Rita, meter maid
Lovely Rita, meter maid
Nothing can come between us
When it gets dark, I tow your heart away
Standing by a parking meter
When I caught a glimpse of Rita
Filling in a ticket in her little white book
In a cap she looked much older
And the bag across her shoulder
Made her look a little like a milit'ry man
Lovely Rita, meter maid
May I enquire discreetly
"When are you free to take some tea with me?"
Took her out and tried to win her
Had a laugh, and over dinner
Told her I would really like to see her again
Got the bill and Rita paid it
Took her home, I nearly made it
Sitting on the sofa with a sister or two
Oh, lovely Rita, meter maid
Where would I be without you?
Give us a wink and make me think of you
Lovely Rita, meter maid
Picture yourself in a boat on a river
With tangerine trees and marmalade skies
Somebody calls you, you answer quite slowly
A girl with kaleidoscope eyes
Cellophane flowers of yellow and green
Towering over your head
Look for the girl with the sun in her eyes, and she's gone
Lucy in the sky with diamonds
Lucy in the sky with diamonds
Lucy in the sky with diamonds, Ah
Follow her down to a bridge by a fountain
Where rocking horse people eat marshmallow pies
Ev'ryone smiles as you drift past the flowers
That grow so incredibly high
Newspaper taxis appear on the shore
Waiting to take you away
Climb in the back with your head in the clouds, and you're gone
Lucy in the sky with diamonds
Lucy in the sky with diamonds
Lucy in the sky with diamonds, Ah
Picture yourself on a train in a station
With Plasticine porters with looking glass ties
Suddenly someone is there at the turnstile
The girl with kaleidoscope eyes
Lucy in the sky with diamonds
Lucy in the sky with diamonds
Lucy in the sky with diamonds, Ah
Oh Dirty Maggie Mae
They have taken her away
And she'll never walk down Lime Street anymore
Oh, the judge, he guilty found her
Of robbin' the homeward bounder
That dirty, no good, robbin' Maggie Mae
'Tis the part of Liverpool
She returned me to
Two pound ten a week
That was my pay

Martha my dear
Though I spend my days in conversation
Please remember me
Martha my love
Don't forget me
Martha my dear
Hold your head up
You silly girl
Look what you've done
When you find yourself in the thick of it
Help yourself to a bit of what is all around you, silly girl
Take a good look around you
Take a good look, you're bound to see
That you and me
Were meant to be
For each other, silly girl
Hold your hand out
You silly girl
See what you've done
When you find yourself in the thick of it
Help yourself to a bit of what is all around you, silly girl
Martha my dear
You have always been my inspiration
Please be good to me
Martha my love
Don't forget me

I said I'm sittin' here watchin'
Matchbox hole in my clothes
I said I'm sittin' here watchin'
Matchbox hole in my clothes
I ain't got no matches
But I sure got a long way to go
I'm an ol' poor boy
And I'm a long way from home
I'm an ol' poor boy
And I'm a long way from home
I've never been happy
'Cause everything I ever did was wrong
Well if you don't my peaches honey
Please don't shake my tree
If you don't want any of those peaches honey
Please don't mess around my tree
I got news for you baby
Leave me here in misery
Alright
(Instrumental/solo)
Well let me be your little dog
'Til your big dog comes
Let me be your little dog
'Til your big dog comes
And when your big dog gets here
Watch how your puppy dog runs
Well I said I'm sittin' here watchin'
Matchbox hole in my clothes
I said I'm sittin' here watchin'
Matchbox hole in my clothes
I ain't got no matches
But I sure got a long way to go
Joan was quizzical
Studied pataphysical science in the home
Late nights all alone with a testtube
Oh, oh, oh, oh
Maxwell Edison
Majoring in medicine
Calls her on the phone
"Can I take you out to the pictures, Joan?"
But as she's getting ready to go
A knock comes on the door
Bang! Bang!
Maxwell's silver hammer came down upon her head
Clang! Clang!
Maxwell's silver hammer made sure that she was dead
Back in school again
Maxwell plays the fool again
Teacher gets annoyed
Wishing to avoid an unpleasant scene
She tells Max to stay
When the class has gone away
So he waits behind
Writing fifty times "I must not be so."
But when she turns her back on the boy
He creeps up from behind
Bang! Bang!
Maxwell's silver hammer came down upon her head
Clang! Clang!
Maxwell's silver hammer made sure that she was dead
P. C. Thirtyone said
"We've caught a dirty one,"
Maxwell stands alone
Painting testimonial pictures
Oh, oh, oh, oh
Rose and Valerie
Screaming from the gallery
say he must go free
The judge does not agree
And he tells them so
But as the words are leaving his lips
A noise comes from behind
Bang! Bang!
Maxwell's silver hammer came down upon his head
Clang! Clang!
Maxwell's silver hammer made sure that he was dead
Silver hammer
Mean Mister Mustard sleeps in the park
Shaves in the dark
Trying to save paper
Sleeps in a hole in the road
Saving up to buy some clothes
Keeps a ten bob note up his nose
Such a mean old man, such a mean old man
His sister Pam works in a shop
She never stops, she's a go getter
Takes him out to look at the Queen
Only place that he's ever been
Always shouts out something obscene
Such a dirty old man, dirty old man
Michelle, ma belle
These are words that go together well
My Michelle
Michelle ma belle
Sont les mots qui vont tres bien ensemble
Tres bien ensemble
I love you, I love you, I love you
That's all I want to say
Until I find a way
I will say the only words I know that you'll understand
Michelle ma belle
Sont les mots qui vont tres bien ensemble
Tres bien ensemble
I need to, I need to, I need to
I need to make you see
Oh, what you mean to me
Until I do I'm hoping you will know what I mean
I love you
I want you, I want you, I want you
I think you know by now
I'll get to you somehow
Until I do I'm telling you, so you'll understand
Michelle ma belle
Sont les mots qui vont tres bien ensemble
Tres bien ensemble
And I will say the only words
I know that you'll understand
My Michelle
The world is treating me bad, misery
I'm the kind of guy who never used to cry
The world is treating me bad, misery
I've lost her now for sure
I won't see her no more
It's gonna be a drag, misery
I'll remember all the little things we've done
Can't she see she'll always be the only one, only one
Send her back to me cause everyone can see
Without her I will be in misery
I'll remember all the little things we've done
She'll remember and she'll miss her only one, lonely one
Send her back to me 'cos everyone can see
Without her I will be in misery
Oh in misery. Oh in misery
Born a poor young country boy
Mother Nature's son
All day long I'm sitting singing songs for everyone
Sit beside a mountain stream, see her waters rise
Listen to the pretty sound of music as she flies
Find me in my field of grass
Mother Nature's son
Swaying daisies sing a lazy song beneath the sun
Mother Nature's son
This happened once before
When I came to your door
No reply
They said it wasn't you
But I saw you peep through
Your window
I saw the light
I saw the light
I know that you saw me
'cause I looked up to see
Your face
I tried to telephone
They said you were not home
That's a lie
'Cause I know where you've been
And I saw you walk in
Your door
I nearly died, I nearly died
'cause you walked hand in hand
With another man
In my place
If I were you
I'd realize that I
Love you more
Than any other guy
And I'll forgive
The lies that I
Heard before
When you gave me no reply
I tried to telephone
They said you were not home
That's a lie
'Cause I know where you've been
I saw you walk in
Your door
I nearly died, I nearly died
'cause you walked hand in hand
With another man in my place
No reply, no reply
I once had a girl
Or should I say
She once had me
She showed me her room
Isn't it good
Norwegian wood
She asked me to stay
And she told me to sit anywhere
So I looked around
And I noticed there wasn't a chair
I sat on a rug
Biding my time
Drinking her wine
We talked until two
And then she said
"It's time for bed."
She told me she worked in the morning
And started to laugh
I told her I didn't
And crawled off to sleep in the bath
And when I awoke
I was alone
This bird had flown
So I lit a fire
Isn't it good
Norwegian wood
You know you made me cry
I see no use in wond'rin' why
I cried for you
And now you've changed your mind
I see no reason to change mine
My cryin' is through, oh
You're giving me the same old line
I'm wond'ring why
You hurt me then
You're back again
No, no no, not a second time!
You know you made me cry
I see no use in wond'rin' why
I cried for you
And now you've changed your mind
I see no reason to change mine
My cryin' is through, oh
You're giving me the same old line
I'm wond'ring why
You hurt me then
You're back again
No, no no, not a second time!
Not a second time
Not a second time
Not guilty
Of getting in your way while you're trying to steal the day
Not guilty
And I'm not here for the rest, I'm not trying to steal your vest
I'm not trying to be smart, I only want what I can get
I'm really sorry for your aging head
But like you heard he said, I'm not guilty
Not guilty
For being on your street, getting underneath your feet
Not guilty
No use handing me a writ while I'm trying to do my bit
I don't expect to take your heart , I only want what I can get
I'm really sorry that you're underfed
But like you heard he said, I'm not guilty
Not guilty
For looking like a freak, making friends with every Sikh
Not guilty
For leading you astray on the roads to Mandalay
I won't upset the apple cart, I only want what I can get
I'm really sorry that you've been misled
But like you heard he said, I'm not guilty
He's a real Nowhere Man
Sitting in his Nowhere Land
Making all his Nowhere plans for nobody
Doesn't have a point of view
Knows not where he's going to
Isn't he a bit like you and me?
Nowhere man please listen
You don't know what you're missing
Nowhere Man, the world is at your command
La, la, la, la
He's as blind as he can be
Just sees what he wants to see
Nowhere Man can you see me at all?
Nowhere Man don't worry
Take your time, don't hurry
Leave it all till somebody else
Lends you a hand
Doesn't have a point of view
Knows not where he's going to
Isn't he a bit like you and me?
Nowhere Man please listen
You don't know what you're missing
Nowhere Man, the world is at your command
La, la, la, la
He's a real Nowhere Man
Sitting in his Nowhere Land
Making all his Nowhere plans for nobody
Making all his Nowhere plans for nobody
Making all his Nowhere plans for nobody
Desmond has a barrow in the market place
Molly is the singer in a band
Desmond says to Molly, "Girl, I like your face,"
And Molly says this as she takes him by the hand
Obladi, Oblada, life goes on, bra
Lala how their life goes on
Obladi, Oblada, life goes on, bra
Lala how their life goes on
Desmond takes a trolley to the jeweler's store
Buys a twenty carat golden ring
Takes it back to Molly waiting at the door
And as he gives it to her she begins to sing
Obladi, Oblada, life goes on, bra
Lala how their life goes on
Obladi, Oblada, life goes on, bra
Lala how their life goes on
In a couple of years
They have built a home sweet home
With a couple of kids running in the yard
Of Desmond and Molly Jones
Happy ever after in the market place
Desmond lets the children lend a hand
Molly stays at home and does her pretty face
and in the evening she still sings it with the band
Obladi, Oblada, life goes on, bra
Lala how their life goes on
Obladi, Oblada, life goes on, bra
Lala how their life goes on
In a couple of years
They have built a home sweet home
With a couple of kids running in the yard
of Desmond and Molly Jones
Happy ever after in the market place
Molly lets the children lend a hand
Desmond stays at home and does his pretty face
And in the evening she's a singer with the band
Obladi, Oblada, life goes on, bra
Lala how their life goes on
Obladi, Oblada, life goes on, bra
Lala how their life goes
And if you want some fun, take obladiblada
I'd like to be under the sea in an octopus's garden in the shade
He'd let us in, knows where we've been, in his octopus's garden in the shade
I'd ask my friends to come and see an octopus's garden with me
I'd like to be under the sea in an octopus's garden in the shade
We would be warm below the storm in our little hide-a-way beneath the waves
Resting our head on the sea bed in an octopus's garden near a cave
We would sing and dance around because we know we can't be found
I'd like to be under the sea in an octopus's garden in the shade
We would shout and swim about the coral that lies beneath the waves
Oh what joy for every girl and boy knowing they're happy and they're safe
We would be so happy, you and me, no one there to tell us what to do
I'd like to be under the sea in an octopus's garden with you
Oh darling, please believe me
I'll never do you no harm
Believe me when I tell you
I'll never do you no harm
Oh darling, if you leave me
I'll never make it alone
Believe me when I beg you
Don't ever leave me alone
When you told me
You didn't need me anymore
Well, you know I nearly broke down and cried
When you told me
You didn't need me anymore
Well, you know, I nearly fell down and died
Oh darling, if you leave me
I'll never make it alone
Believe me when I tell you
I'll never do you no harm
Believe me, darling
When you told me
You didn't need me anymore
Well, you know I nearly broke down and cried
When you told me
You didn't need me anymore
Well, you know, I nearly fell down and died
Oh darling, please believe me
I'll never let you down
Oh, believe me, darling
Believe me when I tell you
I'll never do you no harm
I want a love that's right, right is only half of what's wrong
I want a short-haired girl who sometimes wears it twice as long
Now I'm steppin' out this old brown shoe
Baby I'm in love with you
I'm so glad you came here it won't be the same now I'm telling you
Though you pick me up from where some try to drag me down
And when I see your smile replacing every thoughtless frown
So escaping from this zoo
Baby I'm in love with you
I'm so glad you came here it won't be the same now when I'm with you
If I grow up I'll be a singer
Wearing rings on ev'ry finger
Not worrying what they or you'll say
I'll live and love and maybe some day
Who knows baby you may comfort me - hey!
(Instrumental/solo)
I may appear to be imperfect
My love is something you can't reject
I'm changing faster than the weather
If you and me should get together
Who knows baby, you may comfort me
I know my love is yours, to miss that love is something I'd hate
I'll make an early start, I'm making sure that I'm not late
For your sweet top lip I'm in the queue
Baby I'm in love with you
I'm so glad you came here it won't be the same now when I'm with you
I'm so glad you came here it won't be the same now when I'm with you
Yeah, yeah, yeah
Tu la Tu ru tu
My baby says she's trav'lling on the one after Nineonine
I said move over honey, I'm travelling on that line
I said move over once, move over twice
Come on, baby, don't be cold as ice
'Said you're trav'lling on the one after Nineonine
I begged her not to go and I begged her on my bended knee
You're only foolin' 'round, only foolin' 'round with me
I said move over once, move over twice
Come on, baby, don't be cold as ice
'Said you're trav'llin' on the one after Nineonine
Pick up my bags
Run to the station
Railman says
"You've got the wrong location."
Pick up my bag
Run right home
Then I find
I've got the number wrong
'Said you're trav'llin' on the one after Nineonine
I said move over honey, I'm travellin' on that line
I said move over once, move over twice
Come on, baby, don't be cold as ice
'Said you're trav'llin' on the one after Nineonine. (Yeah.)
Pick up my bags
Run to the station
Railman says
"You've got the wrong location."
Pick up my bag
Run right home. (Run right home.)
Then I find
I've got the number wrong
'Said you're trav'llin' on the one after Nineonine
I said move over honey, I'm travellin' on that line
I said move over once, move over twice
Come on, baby, don't be cold as ice
You said you're trav'llin' on the one after Nineo.
You said you're trav'llin' on the one after Nineo.
You said you're trav'llin' on the one after Nineonine
If you're listening to this song
You may think the chords are going wrong
But they're not; we just wrote it like that
When you're listening late at night
You may think the bands are not quite right
But they are, they just play it like that
It doesn't really matter what chords I play
What words I say or what time of day it is
As it's only a Northern song
It doesn't really matter what clothes I wear
Or how I fare or if my hair is brown
When it's only a Northern song
If you think the harmony
Is a little dark and out of key
You're correct, there's nobody there
And I told you there's no one there
As I write this letter
Send my love to you
Remember that I'll always
Be in love with you
Treasure these few words
Til we're together
Keep all my love forever
P.S. I Love You - you you you
I'll be coming home again to you love
Until the day I do love
P.S. I Love You - you you you
As I write this letter
Send my love to you
Remember that I'll always
Be in love with you
Treasure these few words
Til we're together
Keep all my love forever
P.S. I Love You - you you you
As I write this letter
(oh)
Send my love to you
(you know I want you to)
Remember that I'll always
(yeah)
Be in love with you
I'll be coming home again to you love
Until the day I do love
P.S. I Love You - you you you
You you you
I love you

In Penny Lane there is a barber showing photographs
Of ev'ry head he's had the pleasure to know
And all the people that come and go
Stop and say hello
On the corner is a banker with a motorcar
The little children laugh at him behind his back
And the banker never wears a mac
In the pouring rain, very strange
Penny Lane is in my ears and in my eyes
There beneath the blue suburban skies
I sit, and meanwhile back
In Penny Lane there is a fireman with an hourglass
And in his pocket is a portrait of the Queen
He likes to keep his fire engine clean
It's a clean machine
Penny Lane is in my ears and in my eyes
A four of fish and finger pies
In summer, meanwhile back
Behind the shelter in the middle of the roundabout
The pretty nurse is selling poppies from a tray
And though she feels as if she's in a play
She is anyway
In Penny Lane, the barber shaves another customer
We see the banker sitting waiting for a trim
And then the fireman rushes in
From the pouring rain, very strange
Penny Lane is in my ears and in my eyes
There beneath the blue suburban skies
I sit, and meanwhile back
Penny Lane is in my ears and in my eyes
There beneath the blue suburban skies.
Penny Lane!
Have you seen the little piggies
Crawling in the dirt
And for all the little piggies
Life is getting worse
Always having dirt to play around in
Have you seen the bigger piggies
In their starched white shirts
You will find the bigger piggies
Stirring up the dirt
Always have clean shirts to play around in
In their sties with all their backing
They don't care what goes on around
In their eyes there's something lacking
What they need's a damn good whacking
(Instrumental)
Everywhere there's lots of piggies
Living piggy lives
You can see them out for dinner
With their piggy wives
Clutching forks and knives to eat their bacon
One more time...
Last night I said these words to my girl
I know you never even try girl
Come on, come on, come on, come on
Please please me oh yeah like I please you
You don't need me to show the way love
Why do I always have to say love
Come on, come on, come on, come on
Please please me oh yeah like I please you
I don't want to sound complaining
But you know there's always rain in my heart
I do all the pleasing with you
It's so hard to reason with you
Oh yeah why do you make me blue
Last night I said these words to my girl
I know you never even try girl
Come on, come on, come on, come on
Please please me oh yeah like I please you - oh yeah, like I please you
Well, you should see Polythene Pam
She's so good looking but she looks like a man
Well, you should see her in drag
Dressed in her polythene bag
Yes, you should see Polythene Pam. Yeah, yeah, yeah
Get a dose of her in jackboots and kilt
She's killer diller when she's dressed to the hilt
She's the kind of a girl that makes the "News of the World."
Yes, you could say she was attractively built. Yeah, yeah, yeah
If the rain comes they run and hide their heads
They might as well be dead
If the rain comes, if the rain comes
When the sun shines they slip into the shade
And sip their lemonade
When the sun shines, when the sun shines
Rain, I don't mind
Shine, the weather's fine
I can show you that when it starts to rain
Everything's the same
I can show you, I can show you
Rain, I don't mind
Shine, the weather's fine
Can you hear me that when it rains and shines
It's just a state of mind
Can you hear me, can you hear me?
Okay start again silly boy, take four
All my little plans and schemes
Aren't like some forgotten dream
Seems like all I really was doing
Was waiting for you
Just like little girls and boys
Playing with their little toys
Seems like all we really were doing
Was waiting for love
No need to be alone
No need to be alone
It's real love
Yes it's real
Yes it's real love
It's real
From this moment on I know
Exactly where my life will go
Seems like all I really was doing
Was waiting for love
Thought I'd been in love before
But in my heart I wanted more
Seems like all I really was doing
Was waiting for you
No need to be afraid
No need to be afraid
It's real love
Yes it's real
Yes it's real love
It's real
You say you want a revolution
Well, you know
We all want to change the world
You tell me that it's evolution
Well, you know
We all want to change the world
But when you talk about destruction
Don't you know that you can count me out
Don't you know it's going to be alright
Alright, alright
You say you want a real solution
Well, you know
We'd all love to see the plan
You ask me for a contribution
Well, you know
We're doing what we can
But if you want money for people with minds that hate
All I can tell you is brother you have to wait
Don't you know it's going to be alright
Alright, alright
You say you'll change the Constitution
Well, you know
We all want to change your head
You tell me it's the institution
Well, you know
You better free your mind instead
But if you carrying pictures of Chairman Mao
You ain't going to make it with me anyhow
Don't you know it's going to be alright
Alright, alright
Alright, alright.
Now somewhere in the Black Mountain Hills of Dakota
There lived a young boy named Rocky Raccoon
And one day his woman ran off with another guy
Hit young Rocky in the eye Rocky didn't like that
He said "I'm gonna get that boy."
So one day he walked into town
Booked himself a room in the local saloon
Rocky Raccoon checked into his room
Only to find Gideon's Bible
Rocky had come, equipped with a gun
To shoot off the legs of his rival
His rival, it seems, had broken his dreams
By stealing the girl of his fancy
Her name was Magill, and she called herself Lil
But ev'ryone knew her as Nancy
Now she and her man, who called himself Dan
Were in the next room at the hoedown
Rocky burst in, and grinning a grin
He said, "Danny boy, this is a showdown."
But Daniel was hot, he drew first and shot
And Rocky collapsed in the corner
Now, the doctor came in, stinking of gin
And proceeded to lie on the table
He said, "Rocky, you met your match,"
And Rocky said, "Doc, it's only a scratch
And I'll be better, I'll be better, Doc, as soon as I am able"
Now Rocky Raccoon, he fell back in his room
Only to find Gideon's Bible
Gideon checked out and he left it no doubt
To help with good Rocky's revival
I'd rather see you dead, little girl
Than to be with another man
You'd better keep your head, little girl
Or I won't know where I am
You'd better run for your life if you can, little girl
Hide your head in the sand, little girl
Catch you with another man
That's the end ah, little girl
Well you know that I'm a wicked guy
And I was born with a jealous mind
And I can't spend my whole life
Tryin' just to make you toe the line
You'd better run for your life if you can, little girl
Hide your head in the sand, little girl
Catch you with another man
That's the end ah, little girl
Let this be a sermon
I mean ev'rything I said
Baby, I'm determined
And I'd rather see you dead
You'd better run for your life if you can, little girl
Hide your head in the sand, little girl
Catch you with another man
That's the end ah, little girl
I'd rather see you dead, little girl
Than to be with another man
You'd better keep your head, little girl
Or you won't know where I am
You'd better run for your life if you can, little girl
Hide your head in the sand, little girl
Catch you with another man
That's the end ah, little girl
No, no, no
Creme tangerine and montelimar
A ginger sling with a pineapple heart
A coffee dessert, yes, you know it's good news
But you'll have to have them all pulled out
After the Savoy truffle
Cool cherry cream, nice apple tart
I feel your taste all the time we're apart
Coconut fudge really blows down those blues
But you'll have to have them all pulled out
After the Savoy truffle
You might not feel it now
But when the pain cuts through
You're going to know and how
The sweat is going to fill your head
When it becomes too much
You'll shout aloud
(Instrumental/Solo)
But you'll have to have them all pulled out
After the Savoy truffle
You know that what you eat you are
But what is sweet now turns so sour
We all know obla-dibla-da
But can you show me where you are?
Creme tangerine and montelimar
A ginger sling with a pineapple heart
A coffee dessert, yes, you know it's good news
But you'll have to have them all pulled out
After the Savoy truffle
Yes you'll have to have them all pulled out
After the Savoy truffle

The world was waiting just for you?
Sexy Sadie oh how did you know?
Sexy Sadie you'll get yours yet
However big you think you are
However big you think you are
Sexy Sadie, oh, you'll get yours yet
You gave her ev'rything you owned just to sit at her table
Just a smile would lighten ev'rything
Sexy Sadie, she's the latest and the greatest of them all. Oo
You made a fool of ev'ryone
Sexy Sadie
However big you think you are

She came in through the bathroom window
Protected by a silver spoon
But now she sucks her thumb and wonders
By the banks of her own lagoon
Didn't anybody tell her?
Didn't anybody see?
Sunday's on the phone to Monday
Tuesday's on the phone to me
She said she'd always been a dancer
She worked at fifteen clubs a day
And though she thought I knew the answer
Well, I knew what I could not say
And so I quit the p'lice department
And got myself a steady job
And though she tried her best to help me
She could steal, but she could not rob
Didn't anybody tell her?
Didn't anybody see?
Sunday's on the phone to Monday
Tuesday's on the phone to me, oh yeah
She loves you yeah, yeah, yeah
She loves you yeah, yeah, yeah
You think you lost your love
Well I saw her yesterday - yi - yay
She says she loves you
And you know that can't be bad
Yes, she loves you
And you know you should be glad
She said you hurt her so
She almost lost her mind
And now she says she knows
You're not the hurting kind
She says she loves you
And you know that can't be bad
She says she loves you
And you know you should be glad
She loves you yeah, yeah, yeah
She loves you yeah, yeah, yeah
And with a love like that
You know you should be glad
You know it's up to you
I think it's only fair
Pride can hurt you too
Apologize to her
Because she loves
And you know that can't be bad
Yes, she loves you
And you know you should be glad
She loves you yeah, yeah, yeah
She loves you yeah, yeah, yeah
With a love like that
You know you should be glad
With a love like that
You know you should be glad
With a love like that
You know you should be glad
Yeah, yeah, yeah
Yeah, yeah, yeah
She said I know what it's like to be dead
I know what it is to be sad
And she's making me feel like I've never been born
I said who put all those things in your head
Things that make feel that I'm mad
And you're making me feel like I've never been born
She said you don't understand what I said
I said no no no you're wrong, when I was a boy
Everything was right, everything was right
I said even though you know what you know
I know that I'm ready to leave
Cause you're making me feel like I've never been born
She said you don't understand what I said
I said no no no you're wrong, when I was a boy
Everything was right, everything was right
I said even though you know what you know
I know that I'm ready to leave
Cause you're making me feel like I've never been born
She said I know what it's like to be dead
I know what it is to be sad
I know what it's like to be dead
My love don't give me presents
I know that she's no peasant
Only ever has to give me love forever and forever
My love don't give me presents
Turn me on when I get lonely
People tell me that she's only foolin'
I know she isn't
She don't give boys the eye
She hates to see me cry
She is happy just to hear me
say that I will never leave her
She don't give boys the eye
She will never make me jealous
Gives me all her time as well as lovin'
Don't ask me why
She's a woman who understands
She's a woman who loves her man
My love don't give me presents

Only ever has to give me love forever and forever

People tell me that she's only foolin'
I know she isn't
She's a woman, she's a woman
Wednesday morning at five o'clock, as the day begins
Silently closing her bedroom door
Leaving the note that she hoped would say more
She goes downstairs to the kitchen clutching her handkerchief
Quietly turning the backdoor key
Stepping outside, she is free
She (We gave her most of our lives.)
Is leaving (Sacrificed most of our lives.)
Home (We gave her ev'rything money could buy.)
She's leaving home after living alone (Byebye.)for so many years
Father snores as his wife gets into her dressing gown
Picks up the letter that's lying there
Standing alone at the top of the stairs
She breaks down and cries to her husband, Daddy, our baby's gone
Why would she treat us so thoughtlessly?
How could she do this to me?
She (We never thought of ourselves.)
Is leaving (Never a thought for ourselves.)
Home (We've struggled hard all our lives to get by)
She's leaving home after living alone (Byebye.)for so many years
Friday morning at nine o'clock, she is far away
Waiting to keep the appointment she made
Meeting a man from the motor trade
She (What did we do that was wrong?)
Is having (We didn't know it was wrong.)
Fun (Fun is the one thing that money can't buy.)
Something inside that was always denied (Byebye.)for so many years
She's leaving home. (Byebye.)
Sie liebt dich yeah yeah yeah

Yeah yeah yeah
Yeah yeah yeah yeah
Something in the way she moves
Attracts me like no other lover
Something in the way she woos me
I don't want to leave her now
You know I believe and how
Somewhere in her smile she knows
That I don't need no other lover
Something in her style that shows me
I don't want to leave her now
You know I believe and how
You're asking me will my love grow
I don't know, I don't know
You stick around now it may show
I don't know, I don't know
Something in the way she knows
And all I have to do is think of her
Something in the things she shows me
I don't want to leave her now
You know I believe and how
Let me take you down
'cause I'm going to Strawberry Fields
Nothing is real
And nothing to get hung about
Strawberry Fields forever
Living is easy with eyes closed
Misunderstanding all you see
It's getting hard to be someone
But it all works out
It doesn't matter much to me
Let me take you down
'cause I'm going to Strawberry Fields
Nothing is real
And nothing to get hung about
Strawberry Fields forever
No one I think is in my tree
I mean, it must be high or low
That is, you can't, you know, tune in
But it's all right
That is, I think it's not too bad
Let me take you down
'cause I'm going to Strawberry Fields
Nothing is real
And nothing to get hung about
Strawberry Fields forever
Living is easy with eyes closed
Misunderstanding all you see
It's getting hard to be someone
But it all works out
It doesn't matter much to me
Let me take you down
'cause I'm going to Strawberry Fields
Nothing is real
And nothing to get hung about
Strawberry Fields forever
Always know, sometimes think it's me
But you know, I know when it's a dream
I think a "No," I mean a "Yes,"
But it's all wrong
That is, I think I disagree
Let me take you down
'cause I'm going to Strawberry Fields
Nothing is real
And nothing to get hung about
Strawberry Fields forever. Strawberry Fields forever
Strawberry Fields forever, Strawberry Fields forever

And you're working for no-one but me
Taxman
This is the story of a boy named Ted
If his mother said, "Ted, be good", he would
She told him tales about his soldier dad
But it made her sad, then she'd cry, oh my
Ted used to tell her he'd be twice as good
And he knew he could, 'cause in his head
He said, "Mommy don't worry, now teddy boy's here
Taking good care of you
Mommy don't worry, your teddy boy's here
Teddy's gonna see you through"
Then came the day she found herself a man
Teddy turned and ran, far away, okay
He couldn't stand to see his mother in love
With another man, he didn't know, oh no
He found a place where he could settle down
And from time to time, in his head
He said, "Mommy don't worry, now teddy boy's here
Taking good care of you
Mommy don't worry, your teddy boy's here
Teddy's gonna see you through"
She said, "Teddy don't worry, now mummy is here
Taking good care of you
Teddy don't worry, your mummy is here
Mummy's gonna see you through"
Ooh, ah ooh
This is the story of a boy named Ted
If his mother said, "Ted, be good", he would
If you let me take your heart I will prove to you
We will never be apart if I'm part of you
Open up your eyes now, tell me what you see
It is no surprise now what you see is me
Big and black the clouds may be, time will pass away
If you put your trust in me I'll make bright your day
Look into these eyes now, tell me what you see
Don't you realize now what you see is me
Tell me what you see
Listen to me one more time how can I get through
Can't you try to see that I'm trying to get to you
Open up your eyes now tell me what you see
It is no surprise now what you see is me
Tell me what you see
Listen to me one more time how can I get through
Can't you try to see that I'm trying to get to you
Open up your eyes now tell me what you see
It is no surprise now what you see is me
Tell me why you cried
And why you lied to me
Tell me why you cried
And why you lied to me
Well, I gave you ev'rything I had
But you left me sitting on my own
Did you have to treat me oh so bad?
All I do is hang my head and moan
Tell me why you cried
And why you lied to me
Tell me why you cried
And why you lied to me
If it's something that I've said or done
Tell me what, and I'll apologize
If you don't I really can't go on
Holding back these tears in my eyes
Tell me why you cried
And why you lied to me
Tell me why you cried
And why you lied to me
Well, I beg you on my bended knees
If you'll only listen to my pleas
Is there anything I can do
'Cause I really can't stand it, I'm so in love with you
Tell me why you cried
And why you lied to me
Tell me why you cried
And why you lied to me
Oh, oh
You've been good to me, you made me glad when I was blue
And eternally I'll always be in love with you
And all I gotta do is thank you girl, thank you girl
I could tell the world, a thing or two about our love
I know little girl, only a fool would doubt our love
And all I gotta do is thank you girl, thank you girl
Thank you girl for loving me the way that you do, (way that you do)
That's the kind of love love that is too good to be true
And all I gotta do is thank you girl, thank you girl
Oh, oh
You've been good to me, you made me glad when I was blue
And eternally I'll always be in love with you
And all I gotta do is thank you girl, thank you girl
Oh, oh, oh
Oh, oh, oh
Oh, oh
A friend says that your love won't mean a lot
And you know that your love is all you've got
At times things are so fine and at times they're not
But when she says she loves you that means a lot
A friend says that a love is never true
But you know that this can't apply to you
A touch can mean so much when it's all you've got
And when she says she loves you that means a lot
Love can be deep inside
Love can be suicide
Can't you see you can't hide
What you feel when it's real?
A friend says that your love won't mean a lot
But you know that your love is all you've got
A touch can mean so much when it's all you've got
But when she says she loves you that means a lot
Can't you see? Yeah
Can't you see? Yeah
Can't you see? Yeah
Can't you see? Yeah
Can't you see? Yeah
Can't you see? Whoa!
Can't you see? Yeah
Can't you see? Yeah
Can't you see?
Standing in the dock at Southampton
trying to get to Holland or France
The man in the mac said, "you've got to go back,"
You know they didn't even give us a chance
Christ! You know it ain't easy
You know how hard it can be
The way things are going
They're going to crucify me
Fin'lly made the plane into Paris
honeymooning down by the Seine
Peter Brown called to say
"You can make it OK
you can get married in Gibraltar near Spain."
Christ! You know it ain't easy
You know how hard it can be
The way things are going
They're going to crucify me
Drove from Paris to the Amsterdam Hilton
talking in our beds for a week
The newspapers said, say what're you doing in bed
I said we're only trying to get us some peace
Christ! You know it ain't easy
You know how hard it can be
The way things are going
They're going to crucify me
Saving up your money for a rainy day
Giving all your clothes to charity
Last night the wife said
"Oh boy, when you're dead you don't take nothing with you but your soul." Think!
Made a lightning trip to Vienna
Eating choc'late cake in a bag
The newspapers said
"She's gone to his head
they look just like two Gurus in a drag."
Christ! You know it ain't easy
You know how hard it can be
The way things are going
They're going to crucify me
Caught the early plane back to London
fifty acorns tied in a sack
The men from the press said "We wish you success
it's good to have the both of you back."
Christ! You know it ain't easy
You know how hard it can be
The way things are going
They're going to crucify me
Hey, Bungalow Bill
What did you kill, Bungalow Bill?
Hey, Bungalow Bill
What did you kill, Bungalow Bill?
He went out tiger hunting with his elephant and gun
In case of accidents he always took his mom
He's the all - American bullet - headed Saxon mother's son
All the children sing
Hey, Bungalow Bill
What did you kill, Bungalow Bill?
Hey, Bungalow Bill
What did you kill, Bungalow Bill?
Deep in the jungle where the mighty tiger lies
Bill and his elephants were taken by surprise
So Captain Marvel zapped him right between the eyes. Zap!
All the children sing
Hey, Bungalow Bill
What did you kill, Bungalow Bill?
Hey, Bungalow Bill
what did you kill, Bungalow Bill?
The children asked him if to kill was not a sin
"Not when he looked so fierce," his mummy butted in
If looks could kill it would have been us instead of him
All the children sing
Hey, Bungalow Bill
What did you kill, Bungalow Bill?
Hey, Bungalow Bill
What did you kill, Bungalow Bill?
Oh yeah, all right, are you gonna be in my dream
Tonight?
Love you, love you, love you, love you
Love you, love you, love you, love you
Love you, love you, love you, love you
Love you, love you, love you, love you
Love you, love you, love you..
And in the end, the love you take is equal to the love you make
Day after day, alone on a hill
The man with the foolish grin is keeping perfectly still
But nobody wants to know him
They can see that he's just a fool
And he never gives an answer
But the fool on the hill
sees the sun going down
And the eyes in his head
See the world spinning 'round
Well on the way, head in a cloud
The man of a thousand voices talking perfectly loud
But nobody ever hears him
Or the sound he appears to make
And he never seems to notice
But the fool on the hill
Sees the sun going down
And the eyes in his head
See the world spinning 'round
Nobody seems to like him
They can tell what he wants to do
And he never shows his feelings
But the fool on the hill
Sees the sun going down
And the eyes in his head
See the world spinning 'round
He never listens to them
He knows that they're the fools
They don't like him
But the fool on the hill
Sees the sun going down
And the eyes in his head
See the world spinning 'round
Without going out of my door
I can know all things on earth
Without looking out of my window
I could know the ways of heaven
The farther one travels
The less one knows
The less one really knows
Without going out of your door
You can know all things on earth
With out looking out of your window
You can know the ways of heaven
The farther one travels
The less one knows
The less one really knows
Arrive without traveling
See all without looking
Do all without doing
The long and winding road that leads to your door
Will never disappear, I've seen that road before
It always leads me here, lead me to your door
The wild and windy night that the rain washed away
Has left a pool of tears crying for the day
Why leave me standing here, let me know the way
Many times I've been alone and many times I've cried
Anyway you've always known the many ways I've tried
But still they lead me back to the long, winding road
You left me waiting here a long, long time ago
Don't leave me standing here, lead me to your door
Da da, da da .
We said our goodbyes
Love was in your eyes
Now today I find you have changed your mind
Treat me like you did the night before
Were you telling lies?
Was I so unwise?
When I held you near you were so sincere
Treat me like you did the night before
Last night is the night I will remember you by
When I think of things we did it makes me want to cry
We said our goodbyes
Love was in your eyes
Now today I find you have changed your mind
Treat me like you did the night before
Last night is the night I will remember you by
When I think of things we did it makes me want to cry
Were you telling lies?
Was I so unwise?
When I held you near you were so sincere
Treat me like you did the night before
Say the word and you'll be free
Say the word and be like me
Say the word I'm thinking of
Have you heard? The word is "love."
It's so fine, it's sunshine
It's the word "love."
In the beginning I misunderstood
But now I've got it, the word is good
Say the word and you'll be free
Say the word and be like me
Say the word I'm thinking of
Have you heard? The word is "love."
It's so fine, it's sunshine
It's the word "love."
Ev'rywhere I go I hear it said
In the good and the bad books that I have read
Say the word and you'll be free
Say the word and be like me
Say the word I'm thinking of
have you heard? The word is "love."
It's so fine, it's sunshine
It's the word "love."
Now that I know what I feel must be right
I'm here to show evrybody the light
Give the word a chance to say
That the word is just the way
It's the word I'm thinking of
And you only word is "love."
It's so fine, it's sunshine
It's the word "love."
Say the word, "love,"
Say the word, "love,"
Say the word, "love."
There, there's a place
Where I can go
When I feel low
When I feel blue
And it's my mind
And there's no time
When I'm alone
I think of you
And things you do
Go round my head
The things you've said
Like I love only you
In my mind there's no sorrow
Don't you know that it's so
There'll be no sad tomorrow
Don't you know that it's so
There, there's a place
Where I can go
When I feel low
When I feel blue
And it's my mind
And there's no time
When I'm alone
There, there's a place
There's a place
You say you will love me if I have to go
You'll be thinking of me. Somehow I will know
Someday when I'm lonely, wishing you weren't so far away
Then I will remember things we said today
You say you'll be mine, girl, till the end of time
These days such a kind girl seems so hard to find
Someday when we're dreaming, deep in love, not a lot to say
Then we will remember things we said today
Me, I'm just the lucky kind
Love to hear you say that love is love
And though we may be blind
Love is here to stay and that's enough
To make you mine, girl
Be the only one
Love me all the time girl
We'll go on and on
Someday when we're dreaming
Deep in love, not a lot to say
Then we will remember things we said today
Me, I'm just the lucky kind
Love to hear you say that love is love
And though we may be blind
Love is here to stay and that's enough
To make you mine, girl
Be the only one
Love me all the time girl
We'll go on and on
Someday when we're dreaming
Deep in love, not a lot to say
Then we will remember things we said today
I've got a word or two
To say about the things that you do
You're telling all those lies
About the good things we can have
If we close our eyes
Do what you want to do
And go where you're going to
Think for yourself
Cause I won't be there with you
I left you far behind
The ruins of the life that you had in mind
And though you still can't see
I know your mind's made up
You're gonna cause more misery
Do what you want to do
And go where you're going to
Think for yourself
Cause I won't be there with you
Although your mind's opaque
Try thinking more
If just for your own sake
The future still looks good
And you've got time to rectify
All the things that you should
Do what you want to do
And go where you're going to
Think for yourself
Cause I won't be there with you
Do what you want to do
And go where you're going to
Think for yourself
Cause I won't be there with you
Think for yourself
Cause I won't be there with you
That boy took my love away
He'll regret it someday
But this boy wants you back again
That boy isn't good for you
Though he may want you too
This boy wants you back again
Oh, and this boy could be happy
Just to love you, but oh my
That boy won't be happy
Till he's seen you cry
This boy wouldn't mind the pain
Would always feel the same
If this boy gets you back again
This boy. This boy. This boy
I think I'm gonna be sad
I think it's today, yeah!
The girl that's drivin' me mad
Is goin' away
She's got a ticket to ride
She's got a ticket to rihihihide
She's got a ticket to ride, but she don't care
She said that living with me
Is bringin' her down yeah!
For she would never be free when I was around
She's got a ticket to ride
She's got a ticket to rihihihide
She's got a ticket to ride, but she don't care
I don't know why she's ridin' so high
She oughtta think twice
She oughtta to do right by me
I think I'm gonna be sad
I think it's today, yeah!
The girl that's drivin' me mad
Is goin' away
She's got a ticket to ride
She's got a ticket to rihihihide
She's got a ticket to ride, but she don't care
I don't know why she's ridin' so high
She oughtta think twice
She oughtta to do right by me
Before she gets to sayin' goodbye
She oughtta to think twice
She oughtta to do right by me
She said that livin' with me
Is bringing her down yeah!
For she would never be free when I was around
She's got a ticket to ride
She's got a ticket to rihihihide
She's got a ticket to ride, but she don't care
My baby don't care, my baby don't care
My baby don't care, my baby don't care
There were bells on a hill
But I never heard them ringing
No I never heard them at all
Till there was you
There were birds in the sky
But I never saw them winging
No I never saw them at all
Till there was you
Then there was music
And wonderful roses, they tell me
In sweet fragrant meadows
Of dawn and dew
There was love all around
But I never heard it singing
No I never heard it at all
Till there was you
(Instrumental/solo)
Then there was music
And wonderful roses, they tell me
In sweet fragrant meadows
Of dawn and dew
There was love all around
But I never heard it singing
No I never heard it at all
Till there was you
Till there was you
Turn off your mind relax and float down-stream
It is not dying, it is not dying
Lay down all thought surrender to the void
It is shining, it is shining
That you may see the meaning of within
It is being, it is being
That love is all and love is everyone
It is knowing, it is knowing
That ignorance and haste may mourn the dead
It is believing, it is believing
But listen to the color of your dreams
It is not living, it is not living
Or play the game "existence" to the end
Of the beginning, of the beginning
Of the beginning. Of the beginning
Two of us riding nowhere
Spending someone's hard earned pay
You and me Sunday driving
Not arriving on our way back home
We're on our way home
We're on our way home
We're going home
Two of us sending postcards
Writing letters on my wall
You and me burning matches
Lifting latches on our way back home
We're on our way home
We're on our way home
We're going home
You and I have memories
Longer than the road that stretches out ahead
Two of us wearing raincoats
Standing solo in the sun
You and me chasing paper
Getting nowhere, on our way back home
We're on our way home
We're on our way home
We're on our way home
You and I have memories
Longer than the road that stretches out ahead

We're going home
It's been a long time, now I'm coming back home
I've been away now, oh, how I've been alone
Wait till I come back to your side
We'll forget the tears we cried
But if your heart breaks, don't wait, turn me away
And if your heart's strong, hold on, I won't delay
Wait till I come back to your side
We'll forget the tears we cried
I feel as though you ought to know
That I've been good, as good as I can be
And if you do, I'll trust in you
And know that you will wait for me

I've been away now, oh, how I've been alone
Try to see it my way
Do I have to keep on talking till I can't go on?
While you see it your way
Run the risk of knowing that our love may not last long
We can work it out
We can work it out
Think of what you're saying
You can get it wrong and still you think that it's alright
Think of what I'm saying
We can work it out and get it straight, or say goodnight
We can work it out
We can work it out
Life is very short, and there's no time
For fussing and fighting, my friend
I have always thought that it's a crime
So I will ask you once again
Try to see it my way
Only time will tell if I am right or I am wrong
While you see your way
There's a chance that we may fall apart before too long
We can work it out
We can work it out
Life is very short, and there's no time
For fussing and fighting, my friend

What goes on in your heart
What goes on in your mind?
You are tearing me apart
When you treat me so unkind
What goes on in your mind?
The other day I saw you
As I walked along the road
But when I saw him with you
I could feel my future fold
It's so easy for a girl like you to lie
Tell my why?
What goes on in your heart
What goes on in your mind?
You are tearing me apart
When you treat me so unkind
What goes on in your mind?
I met you in the morning
Waiting for the tides of time
But now the tide is turning
I can see that I was blind
It's so easy for a girl like you to lie
Tell me why?
What goes on in your heart
I used to think of no one else
But you were just the same
You didn't even think of me
As someone with a name
Did you mean to break my heart and watch me die
Tell me why?
What goes on in your heart
What goes on in your mind?
You are tearing me apart
When you treat me so unkind
What goes on in your mind?
Look what you're doin'. I'm feeling blue and lonely
Would it be too much to ask of you
What you're doin' to me?
You got me runnin' and there's no fun in it
Why should it be so much to ask of you
What you're doin' to me?
I've been waiting here for you
Wond'rin what you're gonna do
And should you need a love that's true, it's me
Please stop your lyin'. You got me cryin', girl
Why should it be so much to ask of you
What you're doin' to me?
I've been waiting here for you
Wond'rin what you're gonna do
And should you need a love that's true, it's me
Please stop your lyin'. You got me cryin', girl
Why should it be so much to ask of you
What you're doin' to me?
What you're doin' to me?
What you're doin' to me?
Wo wo ah, wo wo ah

I've got a whole lotta things I gotta say to her
Wo wo ah, wo wo ah

Come on, let me through
I got so many things I gotta do
I've got no bus'ness bein' here with you this way
Wo wo ah, wo wo ah
I got a whole lotta things to tell her
When I get home. Yeah
When I get older, losing my hair
Many years from now
Will you still be sending me a valentine
birthday greetings, bottle of wine?
If I'd been out till quarter to three
Would you lock the door?
Will you still need me, will you still feed me
When I'm sixty four? Ooh
You'll be older too
Ah, and if you say the word
I could stay with you
I could be handy mending a fuse
When your lights have gone
You can knit a sweater by the fireside
Sunday mornings, go for a ride
Doing the garden, digging the weeds
Who could ask for more?
Will you still need me, will you still feed me
When I'm sixty four?
Ev'ry summer we can rent a cottage
In the Isle of Wight if it's not too dear
We shall scrimp and save
Grandchildren on your knee
Vera, Chuck and Dave
Send me a postcard, drop me a line
stating point of view
Indicate precisely what you mean to say
yours sincerely, wasting away
Give me your answer, fill in a form
Mine forevermore
Will you still need me, will you still feed me
When I'm sixty four? Ho!
I look at you all, see the love there that's sleeping
While my guitar gently weeps
I look at the floor and I see it needs sweeping
Still my guitar gently weeps
I don't know why nobody told you how to unfold your love
I don't know how someone controlled you
They bought and sold you
I look at the world and I notice it's turning
While my guitar gently weeps
With every mistake we must surely be learning
Still my guitar gently weeps
I don't know how you were diverted
You were perverted too
I don't know how you were inverted
No-one alerted you
I look at you all, see the love there that's sleeping
While my guitar gently weeps
Look at you all....
Still my guitar gently weeps
I look at you all, see the love there that's sleeping
While my guitar gently weeps
I look at the floor and I see it needs sweeping
Still my guitar gently weeps
I don't know why nobody told you how to unfold your love
I don't know how someone controlled you
They bought and sold you
I look at the world and I notice it's turning
While my guitar gently weeps
With every mistake we must surely be learning
Still my guitar gently weeps
I don't know how you were diverted
You were perverted too
I don't know how you were inverted
No-one alerted you
I look at you all, see the love there that's sleeping
While my guitar gently weeps
Look at you all....
Still my guitar gently weeps
Why Don't We Do It In The Road
Why don't we do it in the road?
Why don't we do it in the road?
Why don't we do it in the road?
Why don't we do it in the road?
No one will be watching us
Why don't we do it in the road?
Why don't we do it in the road?
Why don't we do it in the road?
Why don't we do it in the road?
Why don't we do it in the road?
No one will be watching us
Why don't we do it in the road
Honey pie, Honey pie

I love you
What would you do if I sang out of tune?
Would you stand up and walk out on me?
Lend me your ears and I'll sing you a song
And I'll try not to sing out of key
Oh, I get by with a little help from my friends
Mmm, I get high with a little help from my friends
Mmm, gonna try with a little help from my friends
What do I do when my love is away?
Does it worry you to be alone?
How do I feel by the end of the day?
Are you sad because you're on your own?
No, I get by with a little help from my friends
Mmm, I get high with a little help from my friends
Mmm, gonna try with a little help from my friends
Do you need anybody?
I need somebody to love
Could it be anybody?
I want somebody to love
Would you believe in a love at first sight?
Yes, I'm certain that it happens all the time
What do you see when you turn out the light?
I can't tell you, but I know it's mine
Oh, I get by with a little help from my friends
Mmm, I get high with a little help from my friends
Oh, I'm gonna try with a little help from my friends
Do you need anybody?
I just need someone to love
Could it be anybody?
I want somebody to love
Oh, I get by with a little help from my friends
Mmm, I'm gonna try with a little help from my friends
Oh, I get high with a little help from my friends
Yes, I get by with a little help from my friends
With a little help from my friends. Ah
We were talking - about the space between us all
And the people - who hide themselves behind a wall of illusion
Never glimpse the truth - then it's far too late - when they pass away
We were talking - about the love we all could share - when we find it
To try our best to hold it there - with our love
With our love - we could save the world - if they only knew
Try to realise it's all within yourself
No-one else can make you change
And to see you're really only very small
And life flows on within you and without you
We were talking - about the love that's gone so cold and the people
Who gain the world and lose their soul -
They don't know - they can't see - are you one of them?
When you've seen beyond yourself -
Then you may find peace of mind, is waiting there -
And the time will come when you see we're all one
And life flows on within you and without you
In the town where I was born
Lived a man who sailed the sea
And he told us of his life
In the land of submarines
So we sailed on to the sun
Till we found the sea of green
And we lived beneath the waves
In our yellow submarine
We all live in a yellow submarine
Yellow submarine, yellow submarine
We all live in a yellow submarine
Yellow submarine, yellow submarine
And our friends are all aboard
Many more of them live next door
And the band begins to play
We all live in a yellow submarine
Yellow submarine, yellow submarine
We all live in a yellow submarine
Yellow submarine, yellow submarine
As we live a life of ease
Ev'ryone of us has all we need
Sky of blue and sea of green
In our yellow submarine
We all live in a yellow submarine
Yellow submarine, yellow submarine
We all live in a yellow submarine
Yellow submarine, yellow submarine
Yes, I'm lonely wanna die
Yes, I'm lonely wanna die
If I ain't dead already, ooh
girl, you know the reason why
In the morning, wanna die
In the evening, wanna die
If I ain't dead already, ooh
girl, you know the reason why
My mother was of the sky
My father was of the earth
But I am of the universe
and you know what that's worth
I'm lonely, wanna die
If I ain't dead already, ooh
girl, you know the reason why
The eagle picks my eye
The worm he licks my bones
I feel so suicidal
just like Dylan's Mister Jones
Lonely, wanna die
If I ain't dead already, ooh
girl, you know the reason why
Black clouds cross'd my mind
Blue mist round my soul
I feel so suicidal
even hate my rock and roll
Wanna die. Yeah, wanna die
If I ain't dead already, ooh
girl, you know the reason why
If you wear red tonight
Remember what I said tonight
For red is the color that my baby wore
And what's more it's true
Yes, it is
Scarlet were the clothes she wore
Ev'rybody knows I'm sure
I would remember all the things we planned
Understand, it's true
Yes, it is, it's true
Yes, it is
I could be happy with you by my side
If I could forget her, but it's my pride
Yes, it is, yes, it is
Please don't wear red tonight
This is what I said tonight
For red is the color that will make me blue
In spite of you, it's true
Yes, it is, it's true
Yes, it is, it's true
I could be happy with you by my side
If I could forget her, but it's my pride
Yes, it is, yes, it is
Oh, yes, it is, yeah
Please don't wear red tonight
This is what I said tonight
For red is the color that will make me blue
In spite of you, it's true
Yes, it is, it's true
Yes, it is, it's true
Yesterday, all my troubles seemed so far away
Now it looks as though they're here to stay
Oh, I believe in yesterday
Suddenly, I'm not half the man I used to be
There's a shadow hanging over me
Oh, yesterday came suddenly
Why she had to go I don't know, she wouldn't say
I said something wrong, now I long for yesterday
Yesterday, love was such an easy game to play
Now I need a place to hide away
Oh, I believe in yesterday
Why she had to go I don't know, she wouldn't say
I said something wrong, now I long for yesterday
Yesterday, love was such an easy game to play
Now I need a place to hide away
Oh, I believe in yesterday
Mm mm mm mm mm
I got something to say that might cause you pain
If I catch you talkin' to that boy again
I'm gonna let you down and leave you flat
Because I've told you before
Oh, you can't do that
Well, it's the second time I've caught you talkin' to him
Do I have to tell you one more time I think it's a sin
I think I'll let you down and leave you flat
Because I've told you before
Oh, you can't do that
Ev'rybody's green
'cause I'm the one who won your love
But if they'd seen
You talkin' that way
They'd laugh in my face
So please listen to me if you wanna stay mine
I can't help my feelings, I'll go out of my mind
I'm gonna let you down and leave you flat
Because I've told you before
Oh, you can't do that
Ev'rybody's green
'cause I'm the one who won your love
But if they'd seen
You talkin' that way
They'd laugh in my face
So please listen to me if you wanna stay mine
I can't help my feelings, I'll go out of my mind
I'm gonna let you down and leave you flat
Because I've told you before
Oh, you can't do that

When I see you
I just don't know what to say
I like to be with you
Every hour of the day
So if you want me
Just like I need you
You know what to do
I watched you walking by
And you looked alone
I hope that you won't mind
If I walk you home
Though you've gone away this morning you'll be back again tonight
Telling me there'll be no next time if I just don't treat you right
You'll never leave and you know it's true
Cause you like me too much and I like you
You've tried before to leave me but you haven't got the nerve
To walk out and make me lonely which is all that I deserve
You'll never leave and you know it's true
Cause you like me too much and I like you
I really do and it's nice when you believe me if you leave me
I will follow you and bring you back where you belong
Cause I couldn't really stand it I admit that I was wrong
I wouldn't let you leave me cause it's true
Cause you like me too much and I like you
Cause you like me too much and I like you
I really do and it's nice when you believe me if you leave me
I will follow you and bring you back where you belong
Cause I couldn't really stand it I admit that I was wrong
I wouldn't let you leave me cause it's true
Cause you like me too much and I like you
Cause you like me too much and I like you
You never give me your money
You only give me your funny paper
And in the middle of negotiations, you break down
I never give you my number
I only give you my situation
And in the middle of investigation, I break down
Out of college, money spent
See no future, pay no rent
All the money's gone, nowhere to go
Any jobber got the sack
Monday morning turning back
Yellow lorry slow, nowhere to go
But oh, that magic feeling, nowhere to go!
Oh, that magic feeling, nowhere to go!
Ah Ah
One sweet dream
Pick up the bags and get in the limousine
Soon we'll be away from here
Step on the gas and wipe that tear away
One sweet dream came true today
Came true today, came true today
One, two, three, four, five, six, seven
All good children go to heaven
When I call you up your line's engaged
I have had enough, so act your age
We have lost the time that was so hard to find
And I will lose my mind
If you won't see me, (You won't see me.)
You won't see me. (You won't see me.)
I don't know ooh why you la la la should want ooh to hide, la la la
But I can't ooh get through la la la my hands ooh are tied, la la la
I won't want ooh to stay la la la I don't ooh have much to say, la la la
But I can turn ooh away la la la
And you won't see me, (You won't see me.)
You won't see me. (You won't see me.)
Time after time you refuse to even listen
I wouldn't mind if I knew what I was missing
Though the days ooh are few la la la they're filled ooh with tears,la la la
And since I ooh lost you la la la it feels ooh like years, la la la
Yes it seems ooh so long la la la girl since ooh you've been gone, la la la
And I just can't ooh go on, la la la
If you won't see me, (You won't see me.)
You won't see me. (You won't see me.)

And I loved you like I never done

[Incomprehensible] you'll be mine

You're gonna lose that girl

You're gonna lose that girl
If you don't take her out tonight
She's gonna change her mind
And I will take her out tonight
And I will treat her kind
You're gonna lose that girl
You're gonna lose that girl
If you don't treat her right, my friend
You're gonna find her gone
'Cause I will treat her right
And then you'll be the lonely one
You're gonna lose that girl
You're gonna lose that girl
You're gonna lose
I'll make a point of taking her
Away from you. Yeah
The way you treat her
What else can I do?
You're gonna lose that girl
You're gonna lose that girl
You're gonna lose
I'll make a point of taking her
Away from you. Yeah

She's gonna change her mind
And I will take her out tonight
And I will treat her kind
You're gonna lose that girl
You're gonna lose that girl
You're gonna lose that girl
Here I stand, head in hand
turn my face to the wall
If she's gone, I can't go on
feeling two foot small
Ev'rywhere people stare
each and ev'ryday
I can see them laugh at me
and I hear them say
Hey! You've got to hide your love away
Hey! You've got to hide your love away
How can I even try?
I can never win
Hearing them, seeing them
In the state I'm in
How could she say to me
Love will find a way?
Gather 'round all you clowns
Let me hear you say
Hey! You've got to hide your love away
Hey! You've got to hide your love away
Let's all get up and dance to a song that was a hit
Before your mother was born
Though she was born a long, long time ago
Your mother should know, your mother should know
Sing it again
Let's all get up and dance to a song that was a hit
Before your mother was born
Though she was born a long, long time ago
Your mother should know, your mother should know
Lift up your hearts and sing me a song
That was a hit before your mother was born
Though she was born a long, long time ago
Your mother should know, your mother should know
Your mother should know, your mother should know
Sing it again
Da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da
Though she was born a long, long time ago
Your mother should know, your mother should know

Your mother should know, your mother should know
I know it's true
It's all because of you
And if I make it through
It's all because of you
And now and then
If we must start again
Well, we will know for sure
That I will love you
Now and then
I miss you
Oh, now and then
I want you to be there for me
Always to return to me
I know it's true
It's all because of you
And if you go away
I know you'll never stay
